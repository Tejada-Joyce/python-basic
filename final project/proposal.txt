Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Coupons Finder

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    It will help people find useful coupons when buying in specific stores.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I will learn to use the mysql.connector module and gain more practice with
    exception handling and testing.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    pytest, datetime, mysql.connector

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes, I will.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    Yes, I will.
